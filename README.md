# stm32h7b3i-dk-touchgfx


This project creates a UI on the STM32H7B3I-DK using TouchGFX to control a water pump and a fan from the interface. 
It displays real-time sensor data to provide the best environment for plants, increase productivity, and reduce water consumption.

The project offers two modes of operation:

* Automatic mode: The system decides when to activate or deactivate the pump and fan based on sensor data and user-defined thresholds.

* Manual mode: The user can manually control the pump and fan individually.

It also monitors humidity and dangerous gases in real time, providing a simple and easy-to-read graph.

All user configuration changes are saved in flash memory, allowing the system to restore settings automatically when the project restarts.
